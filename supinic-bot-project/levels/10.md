Implement a "help" command that dynamically shows the list of your bot's commands, either in chat, or on a website, or in pastebin. But it must be dynamic.

Dynamic Command loading in JVM was a nightmare, but it basically gets all classes in the commands module and then instantiates them.
Call method is used whenever the command gets invoked.
